                    <p>
                        If you deplete the enemy ship health bar you win.

                    <p>
                        If your health bar is depleted you lose.

                        Both the player and enemy ships can sustain 10 hits.

                        You can fire cannons at the enemy ship and the enemy ship will fire
                        cannons at you. Each successful hit will remove 1 hit point  from the
                        respective ship.

                    <p>
                        Colliding with the enemy ship will deduct one hit point from <b>both</b>

                        keep the game balanced.)

                    <p>
                        You can click and drag the arrows in the bottom left of the screen to place
                        them on the different move positions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After selecting your moves, press the ready button.

                    <p>
                        Each of your four moves will individually execute at the same time as each of
                        the enemy ships four moves.
                    </p>

                        and you
                        have left any of the movement placeholders empty, your ship will chill
                        for that phase of the movement round (be careful though, because the
                        enemy ship will still move [unless they have been stalled, see protip
                        above]).

                    <p>
                        Selecting forward will move your ship forward one space.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Left / Right</h5>
                    <p>
                        Turning your ship is a little less straight-forward (pun definitely intended).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your ship will first move one space forward, then one space in the selected
                        direction (i.e. left or right).
                    </p>

                <h3>Cannons</h3>
                <div class="indent">
                    <p>
                        You can fire up to two cannons at the end of each individual movement,
                        one on each side of your ship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can specify which cannons you would like to fire by clicking
                        the circles next to the move placeholders.
                    </p>
                    <img class="images" src="images/cannons.png" />
                    <p>
                        Cannons always fire in a straight line with a maximum range of 3 tiles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can fire up to four cannons per turn, and your ship will automatically
                        reload two cannons at the end of each turn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can keep track of how many cannons you have available by checking
                        under the player health bar.
                    </p>
                    <img class="images" src="images/cannon_marker.png" />
                    <p>
                        Your enemy also has a four cannon limit per turn, but they do not reload
                        their cannons until all four have been expended. This design choice
                        helps to balance the game.
